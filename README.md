# QR Algorithm for Finding Eigenvalues of Matrices
This repository contains the implementation of a QR algorithm for finding eigenvalues of matrices, following the reduction of the matrix to Hessenberg form. This project is part of a seminar paper for the Numerical Algorithms course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo.
